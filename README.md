<h1># Smart-Camera-Rig-Generator-for-Blender</h1>
The Smart Camera Rig Generator is a powerful Blender add-on that instantly creates professional, production-ready camera rigs with automated controls, constraints, and custom properties. Perfect for animators, cinematographers, and VFX artists looking to speed up their camera work.

✨ Features

This add-on provides four pre-built camera systems and two utility functions:

    Basic Rig: A standard Aim-and-Dolly rig with separate controls for movement and focus. Great for most shots.

    Crane Rig: Simulates a jib or crane shot with controls for base rotation (pan) and boom elevation (tilt). Ideal for sweeping or overhead movements.

    Orbit Rig: Creates a camera that perfectly orbits a central target, allowing for easy turntable shots or circular movements.

    Handheld Rig: Instantly adds procedural, controllable camera shake/noise to simulate realistic handheld footage.

    Utility: Add DOF Controls: Quickly adds an automatically linked Focus Target Empty and custom properties to any selected camera for easy Depth of Field control.

    Utility: Add Camera Shake: Applies procedural noise modifiers to the selected camera's location/rotation for quick shake effects.
